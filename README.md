### Project Redline 

Project Redline is a narrative-driven ethics simulation game where you play as a mid-level government official in a dystopian regime. Each day, you're assigned a stack of citizen requests—ranging from healthcare access to work permits—and must decide whether to approve, deny, or delay them based on strict government policy.

Should you uphold the law and climb the ranks, or bend the rules to help those in need — risking punishment, demotion, or worse?
