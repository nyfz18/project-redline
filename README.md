### Project Redline 

Project Redline is a narrative-driven ethics simulation game where you play as a mid-level government official in a dystopian regime. Each day, you're assigned a stack of citizen requests—ranging from healthcare access to work permits—and must decide whether to approve, deny, or delay them based on strict government policy.

Will you enforce the regime’s laws to rise through the ranks, or defy them to aid the innocent -- risking punishment, and even death?
